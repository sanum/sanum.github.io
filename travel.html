<h1 style="color: #5e9ca0;">Travel and Accommodation</h1>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Getting to Pretoria</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>By air</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Flying into the&nbsp;<strong>OR Tambo International Airport</strong>&nbsp; is the easiest and most convenient way of getting to Pretoria from other cities in Africa and from other international departure points. It is then a relatively short drive (40 minutes) from the airport to the centre of Pretoria.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Facilities and services at the airport are comprehensive and include several ATMs and banks, a duty-free shopping mall, a selection of bars and restaurants, a business centre and lifts for passengers with disabilities. Information kiosks are located in each of the six terminals. You&rsquo;ll find baggage trolleys and porter services at designated areas throughout the airport, and visitors are cautioned to only use the blue-uniformed porters, who display ACSA-authorised permits.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you're looking for an alternative to OR Tambo International airport,&nbsp;<strong>Lanseria International Airport</strong>&nbsp;is conveniently located North of Johannesburg, with easy access from the West Rand, Pretoria and surrounds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Airport facilities include an upgraded passenger terminal building, restaurants, duty free shopping, lounge facilities, ample parking, easy flow pick up and drop off area and with improved road access getting to Lanseria Airport is hassle&nbsp; free. It is also 40 minutes&rsquo; drive from the airport to the centre of Pretoria.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>By Gautrain from OR Tambo International Airport</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>HATFIELD STATION</strong>&nbsp;(GPS: S:25&deg;44.859&prime; E: 028&deg;14.280&prime;)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Gautrain station at the Airport, is two levels above the Terminal A Arrivals and one level above the Terminal A Departures. Access is via a lift from either the ground (Terminal A Arrivals) or first level (Terminal A Departures), as well as an escalator on the first level (Terminal A Departures) opposite the KFC outlet. There is directions at the Airport itself.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Before you can actually hop onto the train you will have to purchase a Gautrain gold card, you buy them directly from the ticket offices or at the gautrain vending machines, for R13.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When you buy the card, you also pay for, and load, whatever amount of credit you choose, onto the card.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Load around R300 onto your card as this should be sufficient to take you all the way to Hatfield Station and you will be able to use the Gautrain busses, a single fare from the airport to Hatfield is R 183.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You can register your Gautrain Gold Card at a ticket office, you will need your Passport for that.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For the commuting: From the OR Tambo station you travel until you reach the Marlboro station. At the Marlboro Station you get off the train, and take the next train to Pretoria (make sure it is the North-South Commuter) and travel until you reach the Hatfield Station after Pretoria Station.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the Hatfield station you may walk or take a taxi to your hotel.</p>
