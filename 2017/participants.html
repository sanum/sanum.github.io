                Tsunami waves generated during asteroid impacts into oceans and submarine landslides create waves whose characteristics (wave period and amplitude) is significantly different from those generated by more common tsunami sources, such as earthquakes. Earthquake-generated tsunami waves at least are 20 times longer than the ocean depth. Tsunami waves generated by asteroid impacts or submarine landslides are not; they are shorter, but often exhibit much larger amplitudes. Due to the difference in wave period and amplitude, tsunami waves generated by asteroid impacts and submarine landslide experience physical processes, such as dispersion, that require higher-order derivatives in the governing equations to simulate the respective physical processes. Obviously robust and stable numerical solutions of governing equations with higher-order derivatives require smarter numerical methods and stronger computational resources. While I am going to touch upon these issues in my talk, I will focus on the generation mechanisms of tsunami waves by asteroid impacts and submarine landslides. I will introduce the physical processes that govern the characteristics of both generation mechanisms, present examples where they unleashed their destructive power, and introduce a numerical tool to simulate both processes for tsunami simulations to present some quantitative analysis.

		Among the most complex problems in Biomedical science, understanding the functioning of human brain is still 
		one of the biggest challenges of science. Several dynamics coexist in a working brain, each more or less 
		understood in its own, from the electrophysiological activity of the neurons, to the metabolic cycle of the 
		neuron-astrocyte complex and the blood flow in the circulatory system of the Circle of Willis. 
		In order to draw a more comprehensive and coherent picture of the working human brain, computational models are 
		today more relevant than ever. 

		In this talk I will discuss the modeling (and associated challenges) of the local electro-metabolic dynamics in 
		the neuron-astrocyte complex, and the macroscopic propagation of the Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD). 
		The former is a lumped model, coupled through a feedback process of energy supply/demand, that is inherently multiscale 
		due to the different temporal scales of the electrophysiological and meatbolic dynamics. 
		The second is a distributed model, describing the progression, from the visual cortex to the peripheral areas, of a 
		depolarisation wave that has been deemed a correlate of visual aura, a neurological phenomenon preceding migraine. 
		As of today, little is known about the mechanisms that can trigger or stop CSD, but the complex and highly individual 
		characteristics of the brain cortex suggest that the geometry might have a significant impact in its propagation. 
		I will introduce patient-specific computational models to cope with variability and anisotropy of cortical geometries, and 
		discuss our simulation results highlighting the importance of model personalization.

		In this talk I derive a Reynolds equations for chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) and pin-on-disk testing from the Navier-Stokes equations. Coriolis force effects are included in the derivation of the model equations. Half-Sommerfeld boundary conditions are imposed on the numerical solutions of the model equation. The results will be discussed and their implications to the industrial processes of CMP and pin-on-disk testing discussed.

			  <div id="abstract_bishop" class="collapse">
                Einstein's equations form a nonlinear system of hyperbolic partial
		differential equations, and can be solved exactly only in cases of
		high symmetry. As a first step towards obtaining numerical solutions,
		the equations need to be recast from 4-dimensional form into one where
		the evolution is explicit. There are various ways of doing this,
		developed in the 1960s and subsequently. The numerical method applied
		to these equations has normally been finite differencing, but recently
		spectral methods have been widely used for certain types of problem.
		The numerical solution of Einstein's equations requires substantial
		computer resources, and so in practice such methods are used only
		outside the weak-field limit when there is no alternative. This
		includes the most powerful burst sources of gravitational waves, such
		as supernova explosions and compact object coalescence, where compact
		object can be either a black hole or a neutron star.

				<p>Multivalued matrix functions arise in solving various kinds of matrix
					equations.  
					The matrix logarithm is the prototypical example.
					Another example is the Lambert W function of a matrix,
					which is much less well known but has been attracting recent interest.
					A theme of the talk is
					the importance of choosing appropriate principal values
					and making sure that the correct choices of signs and branches
					are used, both in theory and in computation.
					We will give examples where incorrect results have previously been obtained.</p>
					
				<p>We focus on 
					matrix inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic functions,
					beginning by investigating existence and characterization.
					Turning to the principal values,
					various functional identities are derived,
					some of which are new even in the scalar case,
					including a "round trip'' formula that relates 
					<b>acos(cos A)</b> to <b>A</b>
					and similar formulas for the other inverse functions.
					Key tools used in the derivations are the matrix unwinding function and the
					matrix sign function.</p>
				
				<p>A new inverse scaling and squaring type algorithm employing 
					a Schur decomposition and variable-degree 
					Pad&eacute; approximation is derived for computing acos, and it is shown how it
					can also be used to compute <b>asin</b>, <b>acosh</b>, and <b>asinh</b>.
					In numerical experiments the algorithm is found to behave in a 
					forward stable fashion and to be superior to computing these functions via
					logarithmic formulas.</p>

			  <p>In this talk I will describe the construction of a manifold called "multispace" which uses the Lagrange interpolation

            relations, with all appropriate continuum limits guaranteed by the construction.</p>

            <p>Two main applications have been described to date, to discrete integrable systems and to discrete variational systems.

			  <div id="abstract_reddy" class="collapse">
				<p>Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, as the name suggests, are a class of Galerkin finite element methods in 
				which the condition of continuity of functions across element boundaries is relaxed. DG methods have become a 
				powerful tool in the approximate solution of hyperbolic problems, the context in which they were first developed. 
				DG methods have also been applied with much success to elliptic PDEs and systems, and it is this class of 
				applications that will be the focus of this presentation. A simple model problem will serve as the vehicle for 
				motivating the DG approach and comparing it to the conventional finite element method. A further application 
				will be in the context of problems arising in solid and fluid mechanics, and in which dependence on a parameter 
				may lead to singular behaviour of the approximate solution. It will be shown how uniformly convergent DG 
				approaches can be constructed in such situations.</p>
