                Optimal control and inverse problems governed by partial differential equations will
                be considered. The first part of the presentation will derive continuous and discrete schemes for
                optimal control problems subject to nonlinear, hyperbolic conservation laws. The initial condition
                will be treated as the control and a tracking-type problem also with non-smooth desired states will
                be approximated. The second part will consider a simultaneous identification of a coefficient and
                an initial condition of a partial differential equation from boundary measurement problem. An
                identification algorithm will be discussed. Some numerical simulations to show the effectiveness of
                the proposed algorithm will also be demonstrated.

                Discrete Complex Analysis, that is, the quest for discretizing
                    the whole theory and not just single manifestations of it has
                led to a wealth of interesting mathematical concepts and a
                    rich nonlinear theory related to integrable systems. A major
                    question is the construction of discrete analogues of the set
                    of "standard" holomorphic maps and a good model problem
                    is the power map <b>z^a</b>. The stable numerical evaluation of
                    that map touches on many mathematical topics ranging from
                    boundary value problems of discrete Painlev√© equations to
                    infinite-dimensional linear algebra and discrete optimization.

			  <div id="abstract_higham" class="collapse">
				<p>Multivalued matrix functions arise in solving various kinds of matrix
					equations.  
					The matrix logarithm is the prototypical example.
					Another example is the Lambert W function of a matrix,
					which is much less well known but has been attracting recent interest.
					A theme of the talk is
					the importance of choosing appropriate principal values
					and making sure that the correct choices of signs and branches
					are used, both in theory and in computation.
					We will give examples where incorrect results have previously been obtained.</p>
					
				<p>We focus on 
					matrix inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic functions,
					beginning by investigating existence and characterization.
					Turning to the principal values,
					various functional identities are derived,
					some of which are new even in the scalar case,
					including a "round trip'' formula that relates 
					<b>acos(cos A)</b> to <b>A</b>
					and similar formulas for the other inverse functions.
					Key tools used in the derivations are the matrix unwinding function and the
					matrix sign function.</p>
				
				<p>A new inverse scaling and squaring type algorithm employing 
					a Schur decomposition and variable-degree 
					Pad&eacute; approximation is derived for computing acos, and it is shown how it
					can also be used to compute <b>asin</b>, <b>acosh</b>, and <b>asinh</b>.
					In numerical experiments the algorithm is found to behave in a 
					forward stable fashion and to be superior to computing these functions via
					logarithmic formulas.</p>

			  <p>In this talk I will describe the construction of a manifold called "multispace" which uses the Lagrange interpolation 
              data of functions as coordinates and which has the jet space for functions embedded as a sub manifold.</p>

                <p>The purpose for the construction is the simultaneous calculation of smooth and discrete invariants of Lie group 
            actions on the base space, via a moving frame, together with their differential (smooth) and recurrence (discrete) 
            relations, with all appropriate continuum limits guaranteed by the construction.</p>

            <p>Two main applications have been described to date, to discrete integrable systems and to discrete variational systems. 
                I will discuss the application to variational shallow water systems, showing how a simultaneous smooth and discrete </p>
                
            <p>Noether's theorem leads to the conservation of energy and momenta in the discrete scheme, with guaranteed

				<p>In this talk, I will outline results obtained in the last fifteen years, all stemming from the original 
				aim to include boundary conditions into the celebrated Inverse Scattering Transform, which is in essence 
				a nonlinear Fourier transform. </p>

				<p>The talk will revisit the Fourier transform on R, embedding it in a general way of thinking about 
				integral transform that relies on a formulation in the complex domain (called a Riemann-Hilbert 
				formulation) and start from this idea to describe a generalised approach, now known as the unified 
				transform, or Fokas transform. This circle of ideas has produced unexpected and very general results 
				for the solution of  linear boundary value problems, including interface and moving boundary problems, 
				new ideas for numerical schemes,  a way to study of nonselfadjoint differential operators, as well
				as going some way to achieving the original aim of solving nonlinear integrable  problems in domains 
				with boundaries.</p>
				
				<p>I will describe the key ideas and  some of the most unexpected results.</p>

			  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#abstract_reddy">view abstract</button>
			  <div id="abstract_reddy" class="collapse">
				<p>Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, as the name suggests, are a class of Galerkin finite element methods in 
				which the condition of continuity of functions across element boundaries is relaxed. DG methods have become a 
				powerful tool in the approximate solution of hyperbolic problems, the context in which they were first developed. 
				DG methods have also been applied with much success to elliptic PDEs and systems, and it is this class of 
				applications that will be the focus of this presentation. A simple model problem will serve as the vehicle for 
				motivating the DG approach and comparing it to the conventional finite element method. A further application 
				will be in the context of problems arising in solid and fluid mechanics, and in which dependence on a parameter 
				may lead to singular behaviour of the approximate solution. It will be shown how uniformly convergent DG 
				approaches can be constructed in such situations.</p>

				<p>Quadrature is the term for the numerical evaluation

                    because it's so accessible, yet full of conceptual
                    surprises and challenges.  This talk will review ten
                    of these, with plenty of history and numerical
                    demonstrations.  Some are old if not well known,

			  <div id="abstract_vanassche" class="collapse">
				<p>The talk will be about simultaneous Gaussian quadrature (introduced by Borges in 1994) for two integrals 
				of the same function f but on two disjoint intervals. The quadrature nodes are zeros of a type II multiple 
				orthogonal polynomial for an Angelesco system. We recall some known results for the quadrature nodes and the 
				quadrature weights and prove some new results about the convergence of the quadrature formulas. Furthermore 
				we give some estimates of the quadrature weights. Our results are based on a vector
				equilibrium problem in potential theory and weighted polynomial approximation. This is joint work with Doron 
				Lubinsky (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta GA, USA).</p>
