              <b>Abstract:</b>  It is often thought that mathematical models, where equations are derived using fundamental physical laws, lead to accurate representations of reality. After all, if we base our equations on well-established principles such as the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and we find solutions to these equations which are exact or numerical with an acceptably small margin of error, what could possibly go wrong? In this talk, we will examine several mathematical models that describe the behaviour of slow-moving viscous fluids in confined geometries. I will then reveal what happens when these models are tested against laboratory experiments. As we compare theory to experiment, we will discover that even when our models are built on solid physical foundations, they can neglect crucial factors that significantly impact real-world behaviour.  As a result, even a small set of laboratory experiments can play a crucial role in understanding why mathematical models may fail to represent reality. I will show how experiments and theory can be used in tandem, where lab experiments can assist in identifying missing physical mechanisms, narrowing our focus, and ultimately resulting in mathematical models that are a better representation of reality.

              <p><b>Bio:</b> Dr Ashleigh Jane Hutchinson is a Lecturer in Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester, UK. In 2016 she earned her PhD from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. In 2021, she was awarded a prestigious Newton International Fellowship, allowing her to conduct research at Cambridge University, UK. Her research is primarily focused on fluid mechanics, particularly problems involving low-Reynolds number flows and non-Newtonian fluids, which have a variety of applications in both nature and industry. Dr Hutchinson’s approach to solving complex problems is multidisciplinary, combining theoretical modelling, laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. In addition to fluid dynamics, she has a keen interest in other areas of applied mathematics, including population dynamics, energy conservation, and mining.</p>

              <b>Abstract:</b>  The relationship between symmetries and conservation laws has been a subject of interest during the 1800s and culminated in Noether's Theorem of 1918 for variational DEs. 
In this presentation, we discuss this relationship with alternate approaches, e.g., 'partial Lagrangians' and Noether type operators. We also consider 
the extension of this relationship to DEs with 'small parameters via approximate symmetries', discrete equations and fractional DEs.

His PhD thesis involved a range of topics around the Symmetries of Differential Equations, Euler-Lagrange equations and their relationship with Conservation Laws. Abdul has published with collaborators from China, the US, Russia, Pakistan and with his students from SA and abroad.
