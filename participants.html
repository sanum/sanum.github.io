              <b>Abstract:</b>  The relationship between symmetries and conservation laws has been a subject of interest during the 1800s and culminated in Noether's Theorem of 1918 for variational DEs. 
In this presentation, we discuss this relationship with alternate approaches, e.g., 'partial Lagrangians' and Noether type operators. We also consider 
the extension of this relationship to DEs with 'small parameters via approximate symmetries', discrete equations and fractional DEs.

Abdul has published with collaborators from China, the US, Russia, Pakistan and with his students from SA and abroad.
