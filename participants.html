              <p><b>Bio:</b> I am a Professor of Mathematics (and The Michael and Eugenia Brin Endowed E-Nnovate Chair in Mathematics) at the Department of Mathematics, University of Maryland, College Park. My research work focuses on using mathematical approaches (modeling, rigorous analysis, and data analytics) to gain insight and provide understanding on the transmission dynamics of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases of public health significance. Specifically, I design, analyze, parameterize, and simulate novel models for the transmission dynamics and control of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. My research also involves the qualitative theory of nonlinear dynamical systems arising in the mathematical modeling of phenomena in population biology (ecology, epidemiology, immunology etc.) and computational mathematics (with emphasis on the design of robust numerical methods that give results that are dynamically-consistent with the governing continuous-time model being discretized). The ultimate objective of my research work, in addition to the development of advanced (and perhaps novel) mathematical theory and methodologies for studying nonlinear dynamical systems arising in population biology, is to contribute to the development of effective public health policy for controlling and mitigating the burden of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract:</b> The 2018-2020 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) was the first outbreak that occurred in a tumultuous, 
              active conflict and war eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) characterized by the violence, 
              destruction of Ebola Treatment Centres and escape of patients from hospitals. Likewise, the 2014-2016 West Africa 
              EVD came with an unprecedented challenge in that the outbreak simultaneously arose in three different countries 
              (viz. Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) to and from which migrations and travels of people by road and air 
              were considerable. </p>

              <p>For the 2018-2020 outbreak, we develop a Susceptible-Infective-Recovered (SIR)-type model in which the associated 
              disruptive events and the indirect/slow transmission through the contaminated environment are incorporated. 
              Due to the challenge mentioned above for the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak, we construct for it a metapopulation model 
              in each patch of which, we consider an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR) model modified by 
              adding the disease induced deceased, the Isolated and the Quarantine compartments to account, among others, 
              for travellers who undergo the exit screening intervention at the borders, as recommended by the World Health Organization.</p>

              <p>For the two models, our focus is three-fold. We compute the basic reproduction numbers and explicit thresholds, 
              thanks to which the existence and the local/global asymptotic stability (LAS/GAS) of the disease-free, endemic 
              and boundary equilibria (DFE, EE & BE) are investigated. Next, we design nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) 
              schemes that replicate these qualitative properties of the continuous models. Finally, we conduct a global 
              sensitivity analysis and use the real data from the affected regions to provide numerical simulations and 
              undertake a statistical data analytics study, which supports the theory. It is shown that the key parameters, 
              which measure the impact of travels and war, significantly 
              influence the increase in the numbers of infected and deaths individuals of the 2014-2016 and 2018-2020 EVD 
              outbreaks, respectively.</p>

              <b>Abstract:</b> We consider the efficient solution of PDEs using hp-Finite Element Methods, 
                which are finite element methods where both the grid size ($h$) and the 
                polynomial order ($p$) may very. A classical quasi-optimal solver for h-FEM 
                (where the polynomial degree is fixed at 1) is The Fast Poisson Solver which 
                achieves $O(N^2\log N)$ operations with $N$ degrees of freedom in each dimension. 
                Very recently a spectral method,  equivalent to $p$-FEM with a single element, 
                were introduced by Fortunato and Townsend that achieves  quasi-optimal complexity
                 as the polynomial order increases using an Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method. 
                 In this talk, we extend their results for general hp-FEM, achieving complexity that 
                 is optimal independent of the choice of h and p, by using a sparsity respecting 
                 solver for piecewise integrated Legendre polynomials  as introduced by Babuska 
                 combined with ADI. In addition to Poisson and screened Poisson equations on rectangles, we consider s
                olving PDEs on disks and cylinders which are divided into annular elements using
                 non-classical multivariate orthogonal polynomials on annuli.
