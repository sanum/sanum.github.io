  <b>Title:</b> Numerical techniques in the mathematics of gravitational
</div>

        <div id="absHansraj" class="collapse hansraj-swap mb-1 hide" style="text-align:justify;">
<b>Abstract:</b> The gravitational field remains the most mysterious of the four fundamental forces in nature. 
The general theory of relativity (GR) built from the Einstein-Hilbert lagrangian is the most successful 
theories of gravity to date. Nevertheless, it has a number of serious shortcomings necessitating  modifications. 
Currently GR relies on the possible existence of exotic matter for which no support has emerged to date. 
However, a different school of thought works on extending the geometrical sector to accommodate what is 
actually observed. As a consequence a number of modified theories have emerged in the recent past in an 
effort to succeed GR. Each of these must also pass basic tests such as diffeomorphism and Lorentz invariance 
and the Bianchi identities. When GR is applied to construct models of stars, a coupled system of 10 nonlinear 
partial differential equations arises in general in four dimensions. The number reduces to 3 if spherical 
symmetry is assumed however in the case of isotropic or perfect fluid matter field there are 4 unknowns. 
This means that an extra closure condition must be stipulated. The most important physical constraint that 
could be imposed is an equation of state relating two of the variables. The caveat is that the master 
differential equation is not solvable exactly for physically relevant cases. Numerical schemes must be 
implemented to reveal the characteristics of the gravitational field. Ad hoc assumptions on some of the 
dynamical variables may also be made for mathematical expediency however the likelihood of the solution 
satisfying an equation of state is slim. Some 120 exact solutions have been reported over the past century. 
Of these only fewer than 10 tick all the boxes for physical acceptability. The trade-off going down the 
numerical route, on the other hand,  is that while the dynamics may be understood to high degrees of 
accuracy, the geometry in the form of the metric remains unknown. In this talk we shall discuss the 
umerical schemes employed to solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation which emanates from the 
conservation laws also known as the condition for hydrodynamical stability or continuity equation. 
This equation follows from the 3 field  equations however it may substitute any one. 
The system has precisely 3 independent equations. We will examine how the mass-radius relations can 
be found using numerical techniques. Finally we shall comment on how the latest information coming 
from the Nobel-prize winning work on gravitational waves can be used in the study of stellar structure.

        <p><b>Bio:</b> Sudan Hansraj is professor of applied mathematics at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, 
          Durban, South Africa. His research area is Einsteins general theory of relativity and its modifications. 
          He belongs to the school of thought that espouses correction to the action namely the geometric sector of 
          the standard theory to address its shortcomings such as inability to explain the late-time accelerated 
          expansion of the universe without an appeal to exotic matter. He has published some 85 research articles 
          almost 80% in the Q1 category (top 25% in the field) including 8 in the celebrated Physical Review D. 
          He is an NRF rated researcher and has featured in the Standford University ranking of the top 2% of 
          scientists in the world regularly. He is an elected Fellow of the Royal Astronomy Society (UK). 
          Some of his visiting international appointments include: University College London, University of Milan, 
          University of Rio de Janeiro, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Universite de Paris 7th, Inter-University 
          Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics India, Jamia Milia University India, IESER Kolkata, India; 
          Niels Bohr Institute Copenhagen. He has participated in over 80 local and intenational conferences with 5 
          Plenary/ keynote Talks. At UKZN he served as an Academic Leader Mathematics (5 years) and chair of the
           Institutional Forum – a statutory structure tother with the Senate and Council. On the national scence 
           he has been worked with the South African Mathematics Olympiad since 1996 and has served as an IMO jury member. 
           He is a founding member, SA Mathematics Foundation (SAMF) 
          and is currently president of the South African Gravity Society. Prof Hansraj has aalso served the nation on 
          the UMALUSI Council Standardisation Committee for 16 years.</p>

        <p><b>Bio:</b> Prof  Vasil did his PhD in Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics at the University of Colorado. Before that, he studied mixtures of Pure and Applied Mathematics, and Theoretical Physics. He works on topics surrounding Physical Applied Maths, Fluid Mechanics, Plasma Physics, Solar Magnetohydrodynamics and Mathematical Computing.</p>

<p>Since 2012, he has been a founding core-team member of the open-source Dedalus project: <a href="http://dedalus-project.org">http://dedalus-project.org</a></p>

<p>Recently, Dr Vasil has been expanding into new areas. On the more pure side, the rich geometric and combinatorial structures surrounding orthogonal polynomials and special functions (useful, e.g., for the computational framework underlying Dedalus). This includes applications to probability, combinatorics, optimisation and mathematical physics. Further on the applied side, Dr Vasil has been studying differential equations on networks with contiguous edges. This work has wide-ranging applications in mathematical biology and condensed matter physics.</p>
